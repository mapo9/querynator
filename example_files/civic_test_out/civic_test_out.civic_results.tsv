Due to the mutation's high frequency, future therapeutics might target for this single apparent mechanism. However, the consequence of this mutation remain unknown.	70.0

Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.

Oncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.
Class 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.
Class 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.
Class 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase."	673	Targeting of the BRAF gene in papillary thyroid carcinoma (review)., Clinicopathological relevance of BRAF mutations in human cancer., Tumours with class 3 BRAF mutants are sensitive to the inhibition of activated RAS.

FGFR1 signalling downstream functions mainly via PI3K and MAPK pathways (Turner et. al.).
Several ways of involvement of FGFR1 in cancer have been proposed: auto- and paracrine activation, amplification and overexpression (Marshall et. al,  Weiss et. al.,  Cheng et. al.).
Especially amplification of FGFR1 in lung cancer is an emerging treatment target with clinical studies currently ongoing (e.g. NCT01004224). However, FGFR1 amplification does not always correlate with protein expression and predictive biomarkers still remain to be defined in clinic (von MÃ¤ssenhausen et. al.).
Mutation of FGFR1 seems to be less common, but has been described in glioblastoma, pilocytic astrocytomas and Ewing's sarcoma (Rand et. al., Jones et. al., Agelopoulos et. al.)."	2260	Frequent and focal FGFR1 amplification associates with therapeutically tractable FGFR1 dependency in squamous cell lung cancer., Fibroblast growth factor signalling: from development to cancer., Fibroblast growth factor receptors are components of autocrine signaling networks in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells., Fibroblast growth factor receptors-1 and -3 play distinct roles in the regulation of bladder cancer growth and metastasis: implications for therapeutic targeting., FGFR1 as a novel prognostic and predictive biomarker in squamous cell cancers of the lung and the head and neck area., Deep Sequencing in Conjunction with Expression and Functional Analyses Reveals Activation of FGFR1 in Ewing Sarcoma., Sequence survey of receptor tyrosine kinases reveals mutations in glioblastomas., Recurrent somatic alterations of FGFR1 and NTRK2 in pilocytic astrocytoma.
